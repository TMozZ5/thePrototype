How are we going to implement the following SEPP techniques in our project?

1. Version Control - Git (already using)
2. Build Automation - we will use multiple build tools for various phases of the project:
    - Development: we will use Makefiles to automate dependecnies (sqllite3)
    - Testing: see testing
    - CI / CD: see both below
    - Packing: see dependency management
    - Deployment, see containerisation
3. Dependency management - use poetry to handle depency management and packing
4. Testing - we will use Tox to automate testing
5. Continuos integration - we do this naturally on github:
    - push code
    - guthub automatically runs unit tests and linting tests
    - the system reports success or failure
6. Continuos deployment - this is when validated code is automatically deployed to production:
    - Continue from CI, pass the tests
    - Use build tool Github Actions to deploy the build to a staging environment, then final envrionment
    - Use prometheus for monitoring
7. Containerisation - We will use Docker to containersie the code
8. Observability -
