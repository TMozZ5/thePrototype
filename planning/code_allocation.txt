There are three main parts to developing a prototype for the group supermarket order system detailed in EDR. These are developing the database, building the GUI and building the helper methods and functions to integrate these parts together. The final part includes developing the object to simulate interacting with the API endpoints that would be provided by a partnering supermarket API.
Since I have experience in developing GUI interfaces with the chosen language of Python, I thought it best if I took responsibility for that section of the programme. This will involve receiving and passing data to the Database object and thus the supermarket objects also. The plan is to implement this using the inbuilt Tkinter import. This is the most straightforward GUI builder Python offers. It is not the most pretty inference but, since that is not necessary for a prototype, it made Tkinter the obvious choice.
Tom has expressed a keen interest in developing the database and SQL methods required. After discussing with Tom, we decided to move forward and with a simple SQLite database implementation, another inbuilt import with Python. It provides all the functionality required for this prototype and the SQL commands are notably straightforward to execute.
Bingrui and Saibo have agreed to take responsibility for the remaining methods, as well as building tests and amending the code to introduce logs continues integration.
